   We press, chill, and bottle the same day for maximum freshness.

3. Simple filters
   Just enough filtering to keep texture smooth while leaving character in the bottle.

4. No shortcuts
   No added sugar. No artificial anything.
```

### Sourcing Standards

Sourcing Intro: "We source from trusted growers who share our standards. Seasonal rotation is part of the craft."
